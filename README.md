# CityRP

A crappy little DarkRP thing because I'm bored. It's more of a deathmatch mode than a real RP.

It's made from the remnants of a server I used to run with a friend.
I can't find the swep pack on the workshop, but it seems to be a modified version of FA:S.

Some of the code I have no idea who made, so credit goes to whoever did.
