Hello Beauty!
I know you are reading this, you'll know that you can't disable /rpname.
Why? Simple, DarkRP refuses to change your name even with Player:setRPName when this is disabled.
Don't worry, this has a shitty workaround to evade assholes from chagning their names without using this!
If you are not reading this however, then I left a special message for you when trying to use this!
Have Fun.
Feel Free to report bugs and asks question about this addon. As long as they aren't stupid, I'll certainly askwer!
